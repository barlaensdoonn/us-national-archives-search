The scrapbook contains  approximately 130 items, including newspaper clippings, photographs, and a limited number  of manuscript materials, collected between 1855-72.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age—which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system—first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>\"], 'timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:43:42.035Z', 'campaigns': [], 'extract_timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:26:50.534Z', 'date': '2005', 'shelf_id': 'http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'other_title': [], 'count': 60, 'dates': ['2005-01-01T00:00:00Z'], 'number_lccn': ['2006570208'], 'language': ['english'], 'url': '//international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'items': 'http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'hassegments': False, 'image_url': ['https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155', 'https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500'], 'aka': ['http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/kskm/', 'http://lccn.loc.gov/2006570208', 'http://www.loc.gov/item/2006570208/', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/collrbc.rb000009', 'http://www.loc.gov/resource/collrbc.rb000009/']}, {'access_restricted': False, 'original_format': ['collection', 'sound recording'], 'id': 'http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/html/afccards/afccards-home.html', 'partof': ['digital collections', 'american folklife center', 'traditional music and spoken word'], 'subject': ['local history & folklife', 'performing arts'], 'index': 3, 'group': ['collections-portal'], 'title': 'Traditional Music and Spoken Word', 'location': ['united states'], '_partof': 'traditional music and spoken word', 'digitized': True, 'description': ['<p>The audio recordings represented in the catalog were recorded between 1897 and 1962.

Conservation Movement, 1850-1920</em> documents  the historical formation and cultural foundations of the movement to  conserve and protect America\\'s natural heritage, through books,  pamphlets, government documents, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and  motion picture footage drawn from the collections of the Library of  Congress.</p> <p> The collection consists of 62 books and pamphlets, 140 Federal statutes  and Congressional resolutions, 34 additional legislative documents,  excerpts from the <em>Congressional Globe</em> and the <em>Congressional Record</em>, 360 Presidential proclamations, 170 prints and photographs, 2 historic manuscripts, and 2 motion pictures. </p> <h2>Preface: The Early Conservation Movement in Context</h2> <p>Concern for the relationship between humans and the natural world has  been a definitive element in nearly all cultures.  In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature\\'s resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation\\'s  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement\\'s complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans\\' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men\\'s centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation\\'s moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man\\'s relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen\\'s increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation\\'s remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation\\'s natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation\\'s life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt\\'s  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco\\'s proposal to dam Yosemite\\'s Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation\\'s public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans\\'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>'], 'timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:43:42.035Z', 'campaigns': [], 'extract_timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:26:50.534Z', 'date': '1850', 'shelf_id': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'other_title': [], 'count': 744, 'dates': ['1850-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1851-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1852-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1853-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1854-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1855-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1856-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1857-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1858-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1859-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1860-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1861-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1862-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1863-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1864-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1865-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1866-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1867-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1868-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1869-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1870-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1871-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1872-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1873-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1874-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1875-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1876-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1877-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1878-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1879-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1880-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1881-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1882-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1883-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1884-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1885-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1886-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1887-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1888-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1889-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1890-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1891-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1892-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1893-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1894-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1895-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1896-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1897-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1898-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1899-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1900-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1901-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1902-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1903-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1904-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1905-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1906-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1907-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1908-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1909-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1910-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1911-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1912-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1913-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1914-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1915-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1916-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1917-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1918-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1919-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1920-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1996-01-01T00:00:00Z'], 'url': '//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'items': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'hassegments': False, 'image_url': ['https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155', 'https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500'], 'aka': ['http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/conserve/']}, {'item': {'digital_id': ['http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000011', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004.3'], 'medium': ['25,000 items.', '95 containers plus 1 oversize.', '38 linear feet.'], 'repository': ['Library of Congress Manuscript Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA dcu http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mss.home'], 'contributors': ['Arendt, Hannah, 1906-1975.', 'Blücher, Heinrich, 1899-1970.'], 'title': 'Hannah Arendt papers,', 'notes': ['Arranged in ten series.

With over 25,000 items (about 75,000 digital images), the papers contain   correspondence, articles, lectures, speeches, book manuscripts, transcripts of   Adolf Eichmann\\'s trial proceedings, notes, and printed matter pertaining to   Arendt\\'s writings and academic career. The entire collection has been digitized   and is available to researchers in reading rooms at the Library of Congress, the   New School University in New York City, and the Hannah Arendt Center at the   University of Oldenburg, Germany.

The Hannah Arendt Papers (The Library of Congress Manuscript Division). </figcaption> </figure> <p>The Library of Congress received the Arendt Papers as a gift and bequest from   Hannah Arendt in various installments from 1965 to 2000. Small additions were   made by Klaus Loewald in 1981 and Roger Errera in 1994. </p> <p>The papers span the years 1898 to 1977, with the bulk of the material   beginning in 1948, three years before Arendt’s naturalization as an American   citizen. The collection is organized in the following series: Family Papers,   Correspondence, Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and Writings File,   Clippings, Addition I, Addition II, and Addition III. Rich in manuscripts and   correspondence for Arendt\\'s productive years as a writer and lecturer after   World War II, the papers are sparse before the mid-1940s because of Arendt\\'s   forced departure from Nazi Germany in 1933 and her escape from occupied France   in 1941. Documentation for the first part of her life includes a few notebooks   and writings; several official and private records relating mainly to her   divorce, family history, and emigration; and a small group of personal   correspondence with her second husband, Heinrich Blücher, some of whose letters   and unpublished writings can be found in the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/articles-and-essays/family-papers/\">Family Papers</a> series. Much of   the material is in German and other European languages.</p> <p>Born Johanna Cohn Arendt, Arendt later used her married name, Blücher, in   private life. Arendt studied with Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg University, but her   career was diverted from teaching and writing for more than a decade as a result   of Adolf Hitler\\'s rise to power and the subsequent persecution of the Jews.   While in France and for several years in the United States, she worked as a   welfare agent in charge of aiding Jews and as a journalist for various Jewish   political and social organizations. Her papers document her support for the   creation of a Palestinian homeland for Jews until 1948, when she dissented from   certain policies of the new state of Israel.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/auden.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>W.H. Auden. Photographed by Arendt in her New York City   apartment, 1967. Courtesy of the Hannah Arendt Trust. </figcaption> </figure> <p>The largest portion of Arendt\\'s papers consists of the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/correspondence.html\">Correspondence</a> series subdivided under the   headings of General Correspondence, Organizations, Publishers, and Universities   and Colleges. The material traces Arendt\\'s intellectual, social, and   professional life from the late 1940s to her death. Though not a prolific letter   writer, Arendt corresponded with men and women of letters throughout Europe and   America, often for the purpose of giving a reference or arranging conference and   lecture dates, but just as frequently to exchange thoughts and ideas. Her   correspondents include obscure as well as renowned members of the literary and   academic community, many of whom sent her manuscripts in tribute to her   intellectual influence or to solicit her comments. Among the prominent   individuals whose names appear in the general correspondence are poets W. H.   Auden, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, and Stephen Spender; historians Joachim   C. Fest and Carl J. Friedrich; and writers Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Mary   McCarthy, and David Riesman. Readers should note that Arendt often typed replies   on the reverse side of the original letters that she received.</p> <p>Among correspondence pertaining to organizations, publishers, and   universities and colleges are occasional personal jottings from individuals who   wrote in an official capacity but were Arendt\\'s friends and acquaintances as   well. Among their letters is correspondence with publishers and editors,   especially Robert B. Silvers of the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, William   Shawn of the <em>New Yorker</em>, and William Jovanovich of Harcourt Brace   Jovanovich, and with Saul Bellow and other faculty members at the University of   Chicago where Arendt was a professor and graduate student adviser on the   Committee on Social Thought.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/eichmann.html\">Adolf Eichmann File</a> deals with what was perhaps Arendt\\'s best-known and most controversial work, <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>. Subtitled <em>A Report on the Banality of Evil</em>,   Arendt\\'s conclusions about the nature and character of totalitarian rule in Nazi   Germany, and her interpretation of the Jewish response to the Holocaust,   prompted a strenuous and often emotional debate gathered in folders containing   book reviews, articles, and letters to the editors of the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>. Also in the Eichmann files is material that Arendt   collected while covering the Nazi leader\\'s trial in Jerusalem in 1961, including   incomplete but extensive copies of English and German transcripts of the trial\\'s   proceedings, copies of the final ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, and   several files of notes and miscellaneous background information. Drafts and   other related material for <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> are located in the   Speeches and Writings series.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/subject.html\">Subject File</a> chiefly treats Arendt\\'s role as teacher and lecturer as reflected in the courses   she taught at the New School for Social Research, the University of California   at Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. Numerous lectures and seminar notes   by Arendt include copies of \"Kant\\'s Political Philosophy\" delivered at both the   New School and the University of Chicago. Also included is material relating to   Arendt\\'s students as well as contracts and royalties for her publications.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/speeches.html\">Speeches and Writings   File</a> spans the years 1923-75. Arendt\\'s doctoral dissertation, <em>Der   Liebesbegriff bei Augustin</em>, issued by Springer Verlag in 1929, is present in   the original published version and in a manuscript of an English translation, <em>Love and Saint Augustine</em>. Also in this series are various drafts of   lectures and chapters incorporated into Arendt\\'s two-volume work <em>The Life of   the Mind</em>, published posthumously in 1978. Other book-length manuscripts   include the first and final drafts of <em>Between Past and Future</em>; the first   and final corrected copies of <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>, with additional   drafts of the German translation; and <em>Men in Dark Times</em>. There are also   essays and lectures in the Speeches and Writings series in addition to the   lectures and seminar notes in the Subject File folders designated \"Courses\"   Research material arranged by topic is filed under \"Extracts and Notes\" in the   Speeches and Writings series. </p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/mccarthy.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy, ca. 1960s.

An English version of Kohler\\'s work entitled <em>Within Four Walls: The   Correspondence between Hannah Arendt and Heinrich Blücher, 1936-1968</em>,   translated by Peter Constantine (New York: Harcourt), was published in 2000.</p> <p>The papers of Hannah Arendt were initially organized and described in 1965   and 1967. A large group of the material received in 1977 was incorporated into   the collection in 1980. Items received in 1982 were processed as Addition I.   Material received between 1985 and 1997 was organized as Addition II in 1998,   and material comprising Addition III was received and organized in 2000. The   entire collection was reprocessed and the register was revised in 2000.

In view of the lengthy process that would have been   necessary to secure permission to release the entire collection online the   decision was made to concentrate on sections of the papers most useful for   researchers on Arendt and her work. With the advice of special consultant Jerome   Kohn, director of the Hannah Arendt Center, New School University, the project   staff identified the following series as the top priorities for seeking   copyright permissions: the Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and   Writings File, and Addition I, plus the \"General\" section of the Correspondence   File.</p> <p>The procedure to identify copyright holders of published and unpublished   materials in the collection written by people other than Hannah Arendt was a   complex one. For each document needing copyright permission, the author and   recipient, publisher or corporation, address, date, and biographical information   were recorded when available. This information was entered into a database to   facilitate research to identify and locate copyright holders in order to obtain   permissions. Resources online and in print were examined to locate the addresses   of approximately two thousand correspondents or their heirs in the United States   and numerous other countries.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge\\'s idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover\\'s standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation\\'s urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World\\'s fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class=\\'image-align-right\\'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.  The <a href=\"/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/articles-and-essays/forms-of-variety-theater/\">forms of variety theater</a> represented in this collection draw from several genres, including  vaudeville, minstrel show, burlesque, extravaganza, spectacle, musical  revue, and musical comedy.</p>'], 'timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:43:42.035Z', 'campaigns': [], 'extract_timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:26:29.783Z', 'date': '1996', 'shelf_id': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'other_title': ['Vaudeville and popular entertainment, 1870-1920'], 'count': 726, 'dates': ['1870-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1871-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1872-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1873-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1874-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1875-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1876-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1877-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1878-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1879-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1880-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1881-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1882-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1883-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1884-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1885-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1886-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1887-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1888-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1889-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1890-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1891-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1892-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1893-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1894-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1895-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1896-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1897-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1898-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1899-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1900-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1901-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1902-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1903-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1904-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1905-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1906-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1907-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1908-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1909-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1910-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1911-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1912-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1913-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1914-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1915-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1916-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1917-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1918-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1919-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1920-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1996-01-01T00:00:00Z'], 'number_lccn': ['96802670'], 'language': ['english'], 'url': '//memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'items': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'hassegments': False, 'image_url': ['https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155', 'https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500'], 'aka': ['http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/var/', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/varst/', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/american-variety-stage/', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/vaudeville/', 'http://lccn.loc.gov/96802670', 'http://www.loc.gov/item/96802670/', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000048', 'http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000048/']}, {'number_oclc': ['86114510'], 'item': {'call_number': ['Z6951', 'AI3'], 'language': ['eng'], 'contributors': ['Library of Congress.', 'National Endowment for the Humanities.', 'National Digital Newspaper Program (U.S.)'], 'format': ['text'], 'notes': ['Began in 2006.', 'Title from title screen (viewed July 7, 2009).', '\"Chronicling America is sponsored jointly by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress as part of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP)\"--Title screen.'], 'title': 'Chronicling America : historic American newspapers.', 'summary': ['This database allows you to search and view public domain newspaper pages (1690-1963) and find information about American newspapers published between 1690-present.

This program funded state-level projects to locate, describe (catalog), and selectively preserve (via treatment and microfilm) historic newspaper collections in that state, published from 1690 to the present. Under this program, each institution created machine-readable cataloging (MARC) via the Cooperative ONline SERials Program (CONSER) for its state collections, contributing bibliographic descriptions and library holdings information to the Newspaper Union List, hosted by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). This data, approximately 140,000 bibliographic title entries and 600,000 separate library holdings records, was acquired and converted to MARCXML format for use in the Chronicling America Newspaper Title Directory. Contact a CONSER member for updates and corrections to bibliographic records (see <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html\">https://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html</a> ) through CONSER. The Chronicling America Directory bibliographic records are updated annually from the CONSER dataset hosted by OCLC.</p> <h3>Selected Digitized Newspaper Pages</h3>  <p>Each NDNP participant receives an award to select and digitize approximately 100,000 newspaper pages representing that state\\'s regional history, geographic coverage, and events of note. </p> <p>Participants are expected to digitize primarily from microfilm holdings for reasons of efficiency and cost, encouraging selection of technically-suitable film, bibliographic completeness, diversity and &quot;orphaned&quot; newspapers (newspapers that have ceased publication and lack active ownership) in order to decrease the likelihood of duplicative digitization by other organizations.</p> <p>These newspaper materials were digitized to technical specifications designed by the Library of Congress. These specifications include the following basic elements (profiles describing the full set of specifications can be found at <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/\">https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/</a>) : </p> <ul>     <li>TIFF 6.0, 8-bit grayscale, 400 dpi, uncompressed, with specified tag values</li>     <li>JPEG2000, Part 1; 8-bit component; 6 decomposition layers; 25 quality layers; 8:1 compression; with XML Box with specified RDF metadata</li>     <li>Single page PDF with hidden text; downsampled to 150 dpi, using JPEG compression; with XMP containing specified RDF metadata.</li>     <li>Single page machine-readable text encoded in ALTO, v. 2.0 XML; in column-reading order (created with Optical Character Recognition).</li>     <li>METS XML data objects describing newspaper issues, pages, and microfilm reels; incorporating elements in MODS, PREMIS, and MIX formats.</li> </ul>  <p>Chronicling America provides access to these digitized historic materials primarily through a Web interface enhanced with dynamic HTML interactivity for magnification and navigation. Searches are available for both full-text newspaper pages and bibliographic newspaper records (the Newspaper Directory). Pages are displayed in JPEG format, dynamically-created from source files on user request and presented through the browser interface using a combination of Javascript, DHTML and AJAX Web programming.</p> <h3>Preservation Data Repository and Dissemination Application</h3> <p>The NDNP repository developed for Chronicling America is based on the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) Reference Model for preservation repository architecture and supported by a variety of modular components to enable long-term sustainability of data ingestion, archival management and data dissemination. The public website is built using the Python programming language, Django Web framework, RDFLib, Apache Solr search server, Apache Web server, and MySQL database engine.

These items date from 1899 to 1981, with most from the 1920s through the 1950s, and were selected from Copland\\'s\\xa0music sketches,\\xa0correspondence,\\xa0writings, and\\xa0photographs.</p> <p>Celebrating the centennial of the birth of the American composer Aaron Copland (1900-1990), the multi-format Aaron Copland Collection, from which the online collection derives, spans the years 1910 to 1990 and includes approximately 400,000 items documenting the multifaceted life of an extraordinary person who was composer, performer, teacher, writer, conductor, commentator, and administrator. It comprises both manuscript and printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries, writings, scrapbooks, programs, newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, awards, books, sound recordings, and motion pictures.</p>   <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Aaron Copland devoted his life as a twentieth-century composer to fostering, developing, creating, and establishing distinctive \"American\" music. He became known as the \"Dean of American Music,\" a sobriquet with which he was uncomfortable. His name is synonymous with\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\\xa0—the winner of the 1945 Pulitzer Prize in Music—and\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/f/#work0021\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>.</p> <p>Copland extensively documented the many facets of his life in music, and the<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\\xa0at the Library of Congress reflects the entire breadth of his endeavors. Beginning in the late 1950s and early &lsquo;60s, Copland periodically deposited his original music manuscripts at the Library of Congress and subsequently converted them to gifts. In the fall of 1989, he donated all his papers to the Library. The collection numbers approximately four hundred thousand items, dating from 1910 to 1990 with a few nineteenth-century photographs, and includes his music manuscripts, printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries and writings, photographic materials, awards, honorary degrees, programs, and other biographical materials. It is the primary resource for research on Aaron Copland and a major resource for the study of musical life in twentieth-century America generally, particularly from the 1920s to the 1960s.</p> <p>The online\\xa0Aaron Copland Collection\\xa0comprises approximately one thousand items selected from Copland\\'s\\xa0music sketches,\\xa0correspondence,\\xa0writings, and photographs. The items are represented in about five thousand digitized images, the earliest an 1899 photograph and the latest a 1986 letter. While the original collection contains almost all Copland\\'s music manuscripts and printed scores, the online collection presents the original music sketches that Copland used in composing thirty-one works spanning the years 1924 to 1967 and covering every medium in which he composed: orchestral, ballet, opera, film, chamber, solo piano, and vocal music.</p> <p>The correspondence in the online collection comprises images of approximately eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Copland that have been selected from the Aaron Copland Collection and other collections in the\\xa0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\\xa0at the Library of Congress. Besides letters to his parents and other family members in the 1920s and 30s, the correspondence includes Copland\\'s letters to his Parisian teacher Nadia Boulanger, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, and others such as Nicolas Slonimsky, Roger Sessions, Carlos Chávez, Walter Piston, Leonard Bernstein, and Benjamin Britten.</p> <p>As an advocate and supporter of American music and American composers, Copland frequently wrote articles, presented lectures, and delivered speeches. The online\\xa0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\\xa0presents eighty-six of Copland\\'s previously unpublished drafts. These show the creative process through which he wrote about his own music, other composers and their music, and other people who played important roles in his musical life.</p> <p>Of the twelve thousand photographic materials in the Library\\'s Aaron Copland Collection, 111 items have been chosen for online presentation. Many were created by Copland\\'s friend Victor Kraft, a professional photographer. They include portraits of Aaron Copland at various ages and places, with family members, with other composers, and with other people associated with his career as a composer and conductor, as well as images from his worldwide travels.</p>  <h2>The Copland Letters</h2>  <p>\"The man is in the letters,\" said Vivian Perlis of Aaron Copland, whose autobiography she helped to write. The online\\xa0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\\xa0contains digitized images of over eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland covering the years from 1921 to 1986. Searchable texts of all published letters, postcards, and telegrams in the collection are also available.</p> <p>The letters reproduced in the collection represent, though they do not exhaust, the holdings of Copland\\'s correspondence in the\\xa0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\\xa0of the Library of Congress. In general they constitute significant runs of letters to people important in Copland\\'s life. (Problems of copyright and volume preclude making letters to Copland available online.) Every attempt has been made to include all the letters in the Music Division that Copland wrote to each correspondent represented, the one exception being the letters to Harold Spivacke, which constitute only a part of Copland\\'s voluminous and largely business-related correspondence with the Music Division\\'s former chief.</p> <p>These letters come from many collections in the Music Division. Besides material from the Aaron Copland Collection, they contain material from the Leonard Bernstein Collection, the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Collection, the Jacobo Ficher Collection, the Irving Fine Collection, the Louis Kaufman Collection, the Serge Koussevitzky Collection, the\\xa0<em>Modern Music</em>\\xa0Archives, the Walter Piston Collection, the Nicolas Slonimsky Collection, the William Strickland Collection, and the papers of the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music.</p> <p>The letters Copland wrote that are in the Copland Collection proper came back to him in various ways. He inherited his letters to his parents after their deaths. In the 1970s, when he began to think of writing his autobiography, he asked several of his friends and colleagues to send him photocopies of his letters. Some replied with photocopies, some by returning the letters themselves. Some responded with many letters, some with just a few.</p> <p>Copland seldom made carbons copies of his outgoing correspondence. The few periods in his life for which the Copland Collection is rich in carbon copies are the brief intervals when he had a secretary: in 1943 while working on the film\\xa0<em>The North Star</em>; during his South American tour in 1947; in the fall of 1958 when he was staying in London and presumably was provided with a secretary by his publisher, Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Because they were obviously dictated to a secretary, these letters have the flavor of Copland\\'s post-1940 correspondence but are not particularly trenchant, lacking the distinctive qualities that came forth when Copland himself sat down to write.</p>  <p>The following individuals are the major correspondents represented in the letters portion of this online collection. They are listed with the source collection for Copland\\'s letters to them or, in the case of material in the Copland Collection itself, with an indication of whether the letters are originals or photocopies.</p> <p><strong>Arthur Berger</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopy). The online collection contains a <a href=\"/resource/copland.corr0796?sp=1\">single letter</a>\\xa0to this writer of the first book-length study of Copland; it is perhaps the most evocative of Copland\\'s letters describing his Mexican visits.</p> <p><strong>Leonard Bernstein</strong>\\xa0(Bernstein Collection). Copland\\'s protégé in the late 1930s and early 1940s,\\xa0Bernstein\\xa0became one of the leading champions and interpreters of Copland\\'s music.</p> <p><strong>Nadia Boulanger</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; originals). Copland\\'s principal teacher and mentor. His Nonet is dedicated to her.</p> <p><strong>Paul Bowles</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; originals). Composer and novelist. The two letters in the Copland Collection seem to have been part of a voluminous and regular correspondence.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Britten</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopies). English composer. The first set of\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\\xa0was written for Britten and his collaborator Peter Pears. Britten\\'s side of the correspondence is published in Donald Mitchell et al., eds.,\\xa0<em>Letters from a Life: The Selected Letters and Diaries of Benjamin Britten, 1913-1976\\xa0</em>(2 vols., Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991).</p> <p><strong>Carlos Chávez</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopies). Mexican composer; one of Copland\\'s principal composer friends. As a conductor, Chávez performed Copland\\'s <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/s/#work0012\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\\xa0when American conductors had declared it unperformable. Chávez\\'s side of the correspondence and slightly abridged versions of Copland\\'s letters are published in Spanish translation in Gloria Carmona, ed.,\\xa0<em>Epistolario selecto de Carlos Chávez</em>\\xa0(México: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1989).</p> <p><strong>Israel Citkowitz\\xa0</strong>(Copland Collection; originals). Citkowitz was a slightly younger composer (1909-1974), gifted in song and chamber music, for whom Copland had high hopes. The online collection contains all Copland\\'s letters to Citkowitz in the Copland Collection.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge</strong>\\xa0(Coolidge Collection). American patron of chamber music. She commissioned from Copland (and thus had dedicated to her) <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\\xa0and the\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/q/#work0067\">Piano Quartet</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jacobo Ficher</strong>\\xa0(Ficher Collection). Argentinian composer. Copland\\'s letters to him document his interest in South American music.</p> <p><strong>Irving and Verna Fine</strong>\\xa0(Irving Fine Collection). Irving Fine was a composer and younger colleague of Copland whose choral arrangements of several of Copland\\'s <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\\xa0have given them a life as choral works. Copland shared houses with Irving and Verna Fine for several summers at Tanglewood. After Irving Fine\\'s death in 1962 Copland continued to be supportive of Verna Fine, and his letters to her retain warmth and sparkle to the end of his letter-writing years. Copland dedicated \"Sleep Is Supposed to Be,\" one of the two central songs of his<em> </em><a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0074\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>, to Irving Fine. The Irving Fine Collection also contains letters from Copland to Verna Fine\\'s mother, Florence Rudnick, in whose Boston apartment he sequestered himself to write\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/i/#work0065\"><em>In the Beginning</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky</strong>\\xa0(Koussevitzky Collection). Serge Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony from 1924 to 1949, was the first performer to champion Copland\\'s music in America and remained a supporter of Copland (and of many other American composers) until his death. Copland, in turn, was a major help to Koussevitzky from 1940 on in the running of the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood. Copland\\'s letters to Koussevitzky\\'s first wife, Natalie, are, for the most part, social; his letters to Koussevitzky\\'s second wife, Olga (Olga Naumoff, Koussevitzky\\'s secretary, until 1947), concern the running of Tanglewood. Copland\\'s\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0025\">Third Symphony</a>\\xa0is dedicated \"To the memory of Natalie Koussevitzky.\"</p> <p><strong>Minna Lederman</strong>\\xa0(<em>Modern Music</em>\\xa0Archives). Lederman was editor of the journal of the League of Composers,\\xa0<em>Modern Music</em>, which was published from 1924 to 1946. Copland was a major contributor to the magazine and a trusted advisor to Lederman.</p> <p><strong>Marcelle de Manziarly</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; originals). French composer, Boulanger student. Copland dedicated \"Heart, We Will Forget Him,\" the fifth of his<em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em>, to de Manziarly.</p>  <p><strong>Olga Naumoff:</strong>\\xa0see Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky.</p> <p><strong>Walter Piston</strong>\\xa0(Piston Collection). American composer. The body of Piston\\'s correspondence is in the Boston Public Library; the one letter in this online collection represents the small but important collection of letters to Piston from the years 1931-55 that is in the Music Division of the Library of Congress.</p> <p><strong>Florence Rudnick:</strong>\\xa0see Irving and Verna Fine.</p> <p><strong>Roger Sessions</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopies) American composer; co-producer with Copland of the Copland-Sessions Concerts during the years 1928-31.</p> <p><strong>Nicolas Slonimsky</strong>\\xa0(Slonimsky Collection; some early letters in the Koussevitzky Collection). Musical polymath. During most of the period in which Copland corresponded with him he was musical secretary to Koussevitzky; the jokey letters to the incorrigibly humorous Slonimsky serve to balance Copland\\'s oh-so-serious letters to Koussevitzky himself.</p> <p><strong>Harold Spivacke</strong>\\xa0(Coolidge Collection; Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music). Chief of the Music Division of the Library of Congress, 1937-1972. Spivacke\\'s tact and unflappable serenity kept the commissioning of\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\\xa0on course.</p> <p><strong>William Strickland</strong>\\xa0(Strickland Collection). American conductor. Some of the letters in this online collection are concerned with Strickland\\'s editorship of the H. W. Gray organ series, for which Copland wrote his\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/e/#work0097\"><em>Episode</em></a>.</p> <p>\"The man is in the letters.\" It might then seem as though a collection of more than eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland would give a complete portrait of the man and the composer. However, users of this online collection should remember that these letters represent only the holdings of the Music Division of the Library of Congress. At least equally important are Copland\\'s letters to Virgil Thomson (at Yale University); Claire Reis and William Schuman (at the New York Public Library); Howard Clurman, David Diamond, and Walter Piston (at the Boston Public Library); and several others. To each of his correspondents Copland shows a slightly different aspect of his personality, so the letters in this online collection provide a detailed self-portrait if not a complete one.</p>  <h2>The Copland Sketches</h2>  <p>This online collection contains approximately 2500 pages of Aaron Copland\\'s sketches\\xa0for his music, representing thirty-one of his works—thirty-three if one includes the\\xa0<em>Sextet</em>\\xa0and the\\xa0<em>Orchestra Variations</em>, covered by the sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\\xa0and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>\\xa0respectively. Representing many of Copland\\'s best-known and most significant works, the sketches are often revelatory. Except for some miscellaneous accompanying material, the online collection includes all the sketches for the works in the online collection.</p> <p>There are works for which the Library of Congress\\'s archival Copland Collection contains no sketches. These include some of the early works and the\\xa0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>. Those who are interested in finding out whether the Library has sketches for a particular work not represented in the online collection, or curious about whether one of the works included has any material not presented online, should consult the Copland Collection Finding Aid.</p> <p>Within the sections of the online collection, the sketches are presented as much as possible in the order in which they were received from Aaron Copland or his estate. They have been much used by scholars, and they represent Copland\\'s not always systematic use of music-paper. Some sets of sketches have been numbered by stamp at their top left- or right-hand corner; this numeration was done by the Library of Congress when the sketches were filmed in the mid-1970s and do not represent Copland\\'s numbering. When two separate sets of sketches exist for a single work, they are presented here as two separate items. (Note: The page numbers of some of these sketches may not appear in numerical order online. However, they are presented here in exactly the order that Copland produced them.)</p> <p>The sketches reveal to scholars the history of Copland\\'s work on the compositions, but they can also mean something to the general reader. The sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>, the\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>, and the\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0022?sp=1\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>\\xa0show Copland searching for titles to do justice to three of his most characteristic works; the sketches for\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0032?sp=1\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>\\xa0show him deciding what poems to include in the cycle; the sketches for\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0015?sp=1\"><em>Billy the Kid</em></a> show that the opening music was first intended to be the start of\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0014?sp=1\"><em>Music for Radio</em></a>— which now begins with much more complex music.</p>  <h2>The Copland Photographs</h2>  <p>The photographic materials in the Library of Congress\\'s\\xa0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>number more than twelve thousand items spanning the years 1889 to 1985 and include both black and white and color prints, contact sheets, 35-mm negatives, color slides, and photograph albums. A substantial number of photographs were taken by Copland\\'s lifelong friend, the professional photographer Victor Kraft. Widely known photographers whose work can be found in the collection include Carl Van Vechten, Irving Penn, Gordon Parks, and Margaret Bourke-White. The subject material comprises an inclusive chronology of Copland\\'s life and includes Copland\\'s family; Copland himself throughout his life; friends; acquaintances; fellow composers and other people with whom he worked; places where he studied, composed, or visited; and special events.</p> <p>From this vast collection, 111 photographs have been initially selected for the online collection. The digitized images fall into five broad categories: Family ; Copland Alone; Copland\\'s Music; Copland with Other Composers and People; and Places and Events. Photographs that cannot be dated precisely or approximately have been given the designation of \"middle\" or \"late.\"</p> <h2>Family</h2> <p>Of the seven family photographs, one is a formal sitting of Copland\\'s paternal grandparents and three of their children, while another shows Copland\\'s parents, Sarah and Harris Copland, in front of their department store in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922. The other five capture Copland with other family members.</p> <h2>Aaron Copland Alone</h2> <p>The twenty-four photographs of Copland alone show him both formally and informally and at a range of ages from six to his seventies. Several feature Copland at his home, Rock Hill, in Courtlandt near Peekskill, New York.</p>  <h2>Copland\\'s Music</h2> <p>Twenty-one photographs capture performances or rehearsals of thirteen musical works. The orchestral works represented are the\\xa0<em>Piano Concerto</em>, in a photograph showing Copland at the piano and André Previn conducting; the\\xa0<em>Clarinet Concerto</em>with Benny Goodman as the soloist and Copland conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and the\\xa0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>\\xa0in two rehearsal photographs, one in color with Marian Anderson as the speaker and the other with Adlai Stevenson, both with Copland conducting. The two ballets represented are scenes from the premiere performance of\\xa0<em>Appalachian Spring</em>\\xa0at the Library of Congress and\\xa0<em>Billy the Kid</em>, which was premiered by Lincoln Kirstein and the Ballet Caravan.</p> <p>Three of the eight films for which Copland wrote music scores are illustrated in this online collection. Production stills represent\\xa0<em>The North Star</em>\\xa0and\\xa0<em>The Red Pony</em>. There are also two informal photographs of the making of\\xa0<em>The Red Pon</em>y depicting Copland with the pony and the young boy and one studio-recording shot of Copland conducting the music for\\xa0<em>Something Wild</em>\\xa0that shows the star, Carroll Baker, in a television monitor.</p> <p>One chamber work is represented in a rehearsal of the\\xa0<em>Nonet</em>\\xa0at the Library of Congress with Copland conducting. Two photographs depict William Warfield with Copland during rehearsals of\\xa0<em>Old American Songs</em>. There is also a stage shot of the opera\\xa0<em>The Tender Land</em>.</p>  <h2>Copland with Other Composers and People</h2> <p>Numerous photographs capture Copland with fellow composers, including Leonard Bernstein, Carlos Chávez, Norman Dello Joio, Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, Irving Fine, Arthur Berger, Douglas Moore, Benjamin Britten, Darius Milhaud, Philip Ramey, Walter Piston, Domingo Santa Cruz, Virgil Thomson, Roger Sessions, and Igor Stravinsky. He is also shown with such notable cultural figures and musicians as Artur Rubinstein, Claire Booth Luce, Clarence Adler, Nadia Boulanger, Victor Kraft, Vivian Perlis, Claire Reis, Jack Garfein, Thorton Wilder, Serge Koussevitzky, Agnes de Mille, and Oliver Smith.</p> <h2>Places and Events</h2> <p>The group of photographs entitled Places and Events shows Coplan Fontainebleau and Aldeburgh; in Paris, Germany, England, Peru, Israel, and Mexico; at Nadia Boulanger\\'s studio with other students; at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and Tanglewood; and at the University of Kansas, Brown University and Columbia University.</p> <h2>The Copland Writings</h2>  <p>Aaron Copland was best known first as a composer and later, in the 1960s and \\'70s, as a conductor. His name is less frequently associated with literary endeavors. The\\xa0Writings\\xa0portion of the\\xa0Aaron Copland Collection\\xa0suggests that in this respect his reputation should perhaps be revised: it includes a vast array of articles, lectures, speeches, book drafts, and radio and television commentaries that span the years 1925 to 1988. The long stream of Copland\\'s literary efforts began with an article written for publication in 1925, shortly after his return to the United States from three years in Paris, and continued into the late 1970s and early 1980s. He displayed the same technique in his writings that he did in his music: that is, a frequent self-borrowing in which he used the same material in different media.</p> <p>The writings selected for this online collection comprise eighty-six items. The selections represent unpublished drafts of material for articles, lectures, and speeches. Some selections display Copland\\'s literary processes in thoughtful revisions, word changes, rearranging, and other editorial techniques. He usually began with handwritten notes or drafts and proceeded through several typewritten drafts before creating a final unmarked typewritten version. (Example: \"A Visit to Snape,\"\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0026?sp=1\">Version 2</a>\\xa0and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0027?sp=1\">Version 3</a>\\xa0) Not every literary work in the Aaron Copland Collection illustrates this transformation, however. The lectures and speeches display another aspect of Copland\\'s literary endeavors: the fact that he underscored almost every word in red or blue pencil. Because he probably made these markings to help him deliver his speeches, they recapture something of the sound as well as the thought of his vocal presentations. They also add a colorful element to the handwritten and typed drafts.</p> <p>Like many conductors, Copland used a similar device in his conducting scores, where red and blue pencil markings draw the eye to changes in time signature, dynamics, and the entrances of instruments. [Example:\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0092?sp=1\">\"Talk on Leonard Bernstein\"</a>]</p> <p>Whatever their intended uses, the online examples of Copland\\'s unpublished writings can be grouped into four categories: autobiographical, about Copland\\'s music, about other composers, and about other people.</p> <p>The two autobiographical titles contrast the esoteric concerns of\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0005?sp=1\">\"Music and the Human Spirit\"</a>, in which Copland addresses \"the creation of an art music\" as one of \"humanity\\'s truly unique achievements,\" with the practicality of\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0003?sp=1\">\"The Composer as Conductor\"</a>\\xa0in which he recalls that \"Some twenty years ago, during the course of a memorable evening at the Stravinskys\\' home in Los Angeles, the venerable maestro turned to me and said in no uncertain terms: \\'My dear, you should conduct your own music. All composers should conduct their own music!\\'\"</p> <p>The writings about Copland\\'s music highlight eleven of Copland\\'s compositions in five different media. Writings on two ballets describe his collaboration with Martha Graham (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0007?sp=1\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>) and his work with Lincoln Kirstein on the story for<em>Billy the Kid</em>, (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0008?sp=1\">\"About\\xa0<em>Billy the Kid</em></a>\" and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0018?sp=1\">\"Notes on a Cowboy Ballet\"</a>). Copland discusses the creation of his three major solo piano works,\\xa0<em>Piano Fantasy</em>\", \"<em>Piano Sonata</em>,\" and \"<em>Piano Variations</em>,\" in two different lectures under the title <a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0011?sp=1\">Compositional Phases [on My Three Piano Works]</a>.\" An article about the 1925 orchestral work\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0017?sp=1\"><em>Music for the Theatre</em></a>\\xa0summarizes the reaction of audiences, musicians, and reviewers in the United States and Europe, including the performance by the New York Symphony Orchestra in which its conductor, Dr. Walter Damrosch, had \"revenge in the end.\" Copland wrote\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0028?sp=1\">A Visit to Snape</a>\\xa0for a tribute to Benjamin Britten on his fiftieth birthday; in it, he extols the \"kind of composer rapport\" between them and the \"exchange of musical impressions\" between his own \"The Second Hurricane\" and Britten\\'s Piano Concerto No. 1.</p> <p>As the composer of several film scores, Copland was frequently asked to lecture or write about composing for the movies. In his discussions on the subject, Copland speaks not only about his experiences and the scores he wrote, but about other film composers and working in Hollywood. In\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0012?sp=1\">\"Film Music\"</a>, a lecture given at the Museum of Modern Art Film Library in 1940, Copland briefly describes Hollywood and the mysterious nature of film music. He talks about the music he wrote for the film\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0049\"><em>Of Mice and Men</em></a>; four film composers, Eric Korngold, Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, and Herbert Stoddard; and some of their film scores. By the time he gave the lecture\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0015?sp=1\">\"Film Talk\"</a>\\xa0at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1971, Copland\\'s credentials as a film composer included six feature films and two documentaries. On that occasion, excerpts from three features (<em>Something Wild</em>,\\xa0<em>The Red Pony</em>, and\\xa0<em>The Heiress</em>) and one documentary (<em>The City</em>) were screened as he commented on how music may help a film and how one sets music to a film.</p> <p>The largest category of writings in this online collection centers on Copland\\'s views about other composers. In these works, Copland speaks not only about his American contemporaries but about Mozart\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0037?sp=1\">(\"At the Thought of Mozart\")</a>, Berlioz\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0039?sp=1\">(\"Berlioz - from the Composer\\'s Standpoint\")</a>, and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0040?sp=1\">Pierre Boulez</a>;<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0049?sp=1\">Composers in Russia</a>\\xa0and the\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0051?sp=1\">Composers of South America</a>; Michael Tippett (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0055?sp=1\">\"Cousin Michael\"</a>),\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0057?sp=1\">Darius Milhaud</a>, Dmitri Shostakovitch (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0059?sp=1\">\"Dmitri Shostakovitch and the New Simplicity\"</a>),\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0060?sp=1\">Gabriel Fauré</a>,\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0062?sp=1\">Franz Liszt</a>, Gustav Mahler\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0077?sp=1\">(\"Mahler (XX Cent[ury]\")</a>,\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0091?sp=1\">Igor Stravinsky</a>, Serge Prokofieff [Sergey Prokofiev]\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0087?sp=1\">(\"On the Occasion of the 70th Birthday of Serge Prokofieff\")\\xa0</a>, Benjamin Britten\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0090?sp=1\">(\"Special Fondness for B.B. [Benjamin Britten]\")\\xa0</a>, and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0097?sp=1\">Zoltán Kodály</a>. Copland was concerned above all with educating others about composers and their music, and in these writings he sometimes presents his personal viewpoints and reflections. At the National Arts Club in 1968, for example, he spoke about Leonard Bernstein\\'s gifts and how it was \"impossible to imagine the American musical scene in the last quarter century without him.\" [Example:\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0075?sp=1\">\"LB\"</a>]</p> <p>As Copland lived on through the century, he was asked to write celebratory epistles or obituaries about many of his contemporaries, whether they were composers or others who had influenced his life.

M. the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II to the national library of the United States of America through the Honorable A.S. Hewitt Member of the House of Representatives A.H. 1302-1884 A.D.\" </p>  <p>The Sultan\\'s gift arrived in the U.S. Capitol, where the Library of Congress was housed, until the Jefferson Building was completed and they could be unpacked and shelved.</p>  <p>In the 1907 Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam stated: \"About 400 volumes, bound in red Morocco with gilt edges, have been given by the present Sultan, Ghasee Abdul-Hamid II. They comprise works of native authorship, also translations from European languages of works on Medicine, History, Law, Mathematics, Arts, Drama, Fiction, etc.\"</p>  <p>The remarkable story of how the Sultan met and befriended Abram Stevens Hewitt (1822-1903), Member from New York\\'s 10th district, reported in the <em>New York Tribune </em>(July 13, 1884), began while Hewitt and his young son were touring around St. Sophia and palace grounds in Constantinople during a very hot day. When the young boy fainted, he was taken to the guard house where two other boys his age observed all the excitement and reported back to their father, the Sultan, what they had seen.\\xa0Their father dispatched his emissaries to Hewitt\\'s hotel to inquire about his son\\'s well-being and to request that he and his son visit the palace the next day.</p>  <p>During the visit, the Sultan noticed Hewitt\\'s indelible pencil and special cigarettes which resulted in a gift shipment to Abdul-Hamid II when Hewitt returned home. Shortly thereafter, Hewitt received a notice that he owed $1,480 in customs duties on a shipment of Ottoman books. He wrote back to the Sultan that he didn\\'t deserve such an honor and that the Sultan should give the books to the Library of Congress. The Sultan agreed and had the special collection prepared for the Library and invited Hewitt to keep the first set for himself. Hewitt paid the duty and this set is now in the New York University Elmer Holmes Bobst Library.</p>  <p>By 1984, it was determined that the Abdul-Hamid II gift books had become very brittle with paper that was too fragile to serve to researchers and a decision was made to microfilm the collection. 309 books and serials have been scanned from this microfilm for this digital collection.

The Lincoln Papers came to the Library of  Congress from Lincoln\\'s oldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln (1843-1926), who  arranged for their organization and care shortly after his father was  assassinated on April 14, 1865. At that time, Robert Todd Lincoln had the  Lincoln Papers removed to Illinois, where they were first organized under the  direction of Judge David Davis of Bloomington, Illinois, Abraham Lincoln\\'s  longtime associate. Later, Lincoln&rsquo;s presidential secretaries, John G. Nicolay  and John Hay, assisted in the project. In 1874, most of the Lincoln Papers  returned to Washington, D.C., and Nicolay and Hay used them in the research and  writing of their ten-volume biography, <em>Abraham Lincoln: A History</em> (New  York, 1890). Robert Todd Lincoln deposited the Lincoln Papers with the Library  of Congress in 1919, and deeded them to the Library on January 23, 1923. The  deed stipulated that the Lincoln Papers remain sealed until twenty-one years  after Robert Todd Lincoln&rsquo;s death. On July 26, 1947, the Lincoln Papers were  officially opened to the public. </p>  <p>The most complete account  of the early history of the Abraham Lincoln Papers appears in volume 1 of David  C. Mearns, <em>The Lincoln Papers</em> (Garden City, N.Y., 1948), 3-136. An  article by the same author which appeared in the December 1947 issue of the <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/alajournals/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Abraham Lincoln Quarterly</em> <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"><span>External</span></i></a> contains the substance of the story.

Original  items contained in Series 4 are included in this online collection and include  letters written by Abraham Lincoln, an autobiographical sketch written in 1859  at the request of Jesse W.

The Lincoln Studies Center at Knox  College in Galesburg, Illinois performed the editorial work, which included  selecting the documents to be transcribed. &nbsp;Their choices were based on  either a document\\'s historical importance or as representative of the  president&rsquo;s unsolicited incoming mail. Annotated transcriptions were provided  for all of the documents in Lincoln\\'s own hand and for secretarial copies of  Lincoln documents located in Series 1-3 of the Lincoln Papers.&nbsp;Many of the  other transcriptions were also annotated to aid users in identifying the people  involved and in better understanding the content and historical contexts.&nbsp;Annotations for Lincoln\\'s  autograph documents usually include a headnote providing historical and  documentary context, as well as annotations on the content of the document.  Annotations for incoming correspondence typically identify persons and  organizations writing to Lincoln or referred to in the documents, explain terms  and events, and provide brief historical context. Together, these fully  searchable transcriptions and annotations dramatically extend access to the  Abraham Lincoln Papers and enhance their teaching and research value.

He traveled in a 1935 Plymouth sedan, toting a Presto disc recorder and a movie camera. When he returned nearly three months later, having driven thousands of miles on barely paved roads, it was with a cache of 250 instantaneous discs and eight reels of film documenting the incredible range of ethnic diversity and expressive traditions primarily in Michigan. </p> <p>The Alan Lomax collection of Michigan and Wisconsin recordings (AFC 1939/007) documents Irish, Italian, Finnish, Serbian, Lithuanian, Polish, German, Croatian, French Canadian, Hungarian, Romanian, and Swedish songs and stories, as well as occupational folklife among loggers and lake sailors in Michigan and Wisconsin. Lomax&rsquo;s itinerary took him from Detroit through the Saginaw River valley to the northern counties of the Lower Peninsula, including Beaver Island. Crossing the Straits of Mackinac, he collected across the Upper Peninsula to the far northern Calumet area and then along the Lake Superior coast to easternmost Wisconsin.</p> <p>The recordings in this collection and related collections in the American Folklife Center provide early documentation of the Upper Midwest&rsquo;s rich culture. This collection is the result of a conscious decision by the Library of Congress to undertake regional documentation of American folk song in recognition that the voices of ordinary people have a place at the national library. The sound recordings in this online collection are presented in their raw form, as full disc sides without speed correction or other digital processing.

Therefore, one of the main objectives of the selection process was to identify those materials which mainly focused on Alexander Graham Bell and his work, varied interests, and achievements. Another important goal was to choose those materials that best offered a well-rounded portrayal of Bell--not only as an inventor and scientist but also as a teacher, husband, and father. Items were also selected if they appeared historically useful or significant, such as correspondence pertaining to the development of the Bell Telephone Company or Mabel Hubbard Bell\\'s written accounts of her experiences growing up deaf. </p>  <p> The Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers were donated to the Library of Congress by his heirs in 1975. Prior to this donation, the papers were on deposit at the National Geographic Society, where they were organized and maintained. In order to make the collection easier to use, the Society prepared typed transcripts of a large portion of the handwritten letters. These valuable transcriptions were retained and have been reproduced here along with the original letters. Occasionally the original is missing and only the transcription is still available. One should keep in mind that these transcripts are now decades old and may occasionally be difficult to read due to faded, bleeding, or blurred text.</p>  <p> The Bell Papers contain a considerable amount of correspondence, much of which reflects the writing practices of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As letter writing becomes less popular, some awareness of common, older practices may be helpful. Since the typical handwritten letter is essentially a single sheet of paper folded in half (and usually written on all four sides), the digital scan and display of each unfolded sheet usually show an image of pages four and one (or back and front), and another of pages three and two (or the inside two pages). <a href=\"/resource/magbell.03500220/seq-1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Today\\'s readers also should be aware of such papers-saving tactics as writing-over, or text over text. In such cases, the writer would literally write over a completed page, making the added words somewhat readable by turning the page sideways and writing horizontally against what were now vertical written lines. <a href=\"/resource/magbell.02800127/?sp=1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Surprisingly, if the writer was careful and lengthened his or her hand while also trying to write only in the spaces between lines, such letters can be read with little difficulty. </p>    <div class=\"i_aligncenter i_caption\"       style=\"width: 444px;\">  <a href=\"/item/magbellbib000925\"><img

United States, and cases forming the LeGuen v. Gouverneur and Kemble litigation.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+financial+papers%2C+1782-1804\">Financial Papers, 1782-1804</a> (Reel 29)</strong><br>    The financial papers, which form the smallest segment of the collection, consist of two volumes of accounts relating to Hamilton\\'s law practice, and a folder of miscellaneous receipts. Some of the receipts are for money Hamilton paid engineer William Pearce on behalf of the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures to provide machinery for manufacturing cotton, 1791-1792.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+family+papers%2C+1737-1917\">Family Papers, 1737-1917</a></strong>  (Reels 29-31)</strong><br>    Letters and other documents of members of the Hamilton, Schuyler, and related families, but not including Alexander Hamilton himself.

Through the marriage of Philip Hamilton to Rebecca McLane, several McLane family letters were incorporated into the papers. Most of the nonfamily correspondence of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton relates to the management of her properties and to arrangements for the publication of Hamilton\\'s papers. Scattered letters addressed to Alexander Hamilton (Alexander and Elizabeth\\'s grandson), James A. Hamilton, John Church Hamilton, and to members of the McLane family are also included.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+miscellany%2C+1711-1820\">Miscellany, 1711-1820</a> (Reels 31-34)</strong><br>    A mixture of original and copied documents.

Fifty-one of these, 1790-1804, are from Philip Schuyler (1733-1804) to his  son-in-law Alexander Hamilton and daughter Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton.

The scrapbook contains  approximately 130 items, including newspaper clippings, photographs, and a limited number  of manuscript materials, collected between 1855-72.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age—which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system—first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>\"], 'timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:43:42.035Z', 'campaigns': [], 'extract_timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:26:50.534Z', 'date': '2005', 'shelf_id': 'http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'other_title': [], 'count': 60, 'dates': ['2005-01-01T00:00:00Z'], 'number_lccn': ['2006570208'], 'language': ['english'], 'url': '//international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'items': 'http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'hassegments': False, 'image_url': ['https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155', 'https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500'], 'aka': ['http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/kskm/', 'http://lccn.loc.gov/2006570208', 'http://www.loc.gov/item/2006570208/', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/collrbc.rb000009', 'http://www.loc.gov/resource/collrbc.rb000009/']}, {'access_restricted': False, 'original_format': ['collection', 'sound recording'], 'id': 'http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/html/afccards/afccards-home.html', 'partof': ['digital collections', 'american folklife center', 'traditional music and spoken word'], 'subject': ['local history & folklife', 'performing arts'], 'index': 3, 'group': ['collections-portal'], 'title': 'Traditional Music and Spoken Word', 'location': ['united states'], '_partof': 'traditional music and spoken word', 'digitized': True, 'description': ['<p>The audio recordings represented in the catalog were recorded between 1897 and 1962.

Conservation Movement, 1850-1920</em> documents  the historical formation and cultural foundations of the movement to  conserve and protect America\\'s natural heritage, through books,  pamphlets, government documents, manuscripts, prints, photographs, and  motion picture footage drawn from the collections of the Library of  Congress.</p> <p> The collection consists of 62 books and pamphlets, 140 Federal statutes  and Congressional resolutions, 34 additional legislative documents,  excerpts from the <em>Congressional Globe</em> and the <em>Congressional Record</em>, 360 Presidential proclamations, 170 prints and photographs, 2 historic manuscripts, and 2 motion pictures. </p> <h2>Preface: The Early Conservation Movement in Context</h2> <p>Concern for the relationship between humans and the natural world has  been a definitive element in nearly all cultures.  In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature\\'s resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation\\'s  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement\\'s complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans\\' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men\\'s centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation\\'s moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man\\'s relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen\\'s increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation\\'s remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation\\'s natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation\\'s life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt\\'s  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco\\'s proposal to dam Yosemite\\'s Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation\\'s public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans\\'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>'], 'timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:43:42.035Z', 'campaigns': [], 'extract_timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:26:50.534Z', 'date': '1850', 'shelf_id': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'other_title': [], 'count': 744, 'dates': ['1850-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1851-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1852-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1853-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1854-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1855-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1856-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1857-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1858-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1859-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1860-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1861-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1862-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1863-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1864-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1865-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1866-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1867-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1868-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1869-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1870-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1871-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1872-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1873-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1874-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1875-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1876-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1877-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1878-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1879-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1880-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1881-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1882-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1883-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1884-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1885-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1886-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1887-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1888-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1889-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1890-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1891-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1892-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1893-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1894-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1895-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1896-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1897-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1898-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1899-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1900-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1901-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1902-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1903-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1904-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1905-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1906-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1907-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1908-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1909-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1910-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1911-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1912-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1913-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1914-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1915-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1916-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1917-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1918-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1919-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1920-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1996-01-01T00:00:00Z'], 'url': '//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'items': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'hassegments': False, 'image_url': ['https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155', 'https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500'], 'aka': ['http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/conserve/']}, {'item': {'digital_id': ['http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000011', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004.3'], 'medium': ['25,000 items.', '95 containers plus 1 oversize.', '38 linear feet.'], 'repository': ['Library of Congress Manuscript Division Washington, D.C. 20540 USA dcu http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/mss.home'], 'contributors': ['Arendt, Hannah, 1906-1975.', 'Blücher, Heinrich, 1899-1970.'], 'title': 'Hannah Arendt papers,', 'notes': ['Arranged in ten series.

With over 25,000 items (about 75,000 digital images), the papers contain   correspondence, articles, lectures, speeches, book manuscripts, transcripts of   Adolf Eichmann\\'s trial proceedings, notes, and printed matter pertaining to   Arendt\\'s writings and academic career. The entire collection has been digitized   and is available to researchers in reading rooms at the Library of Congress, the   New School University in New York City, and the Hannah Arendt Center at the   University of Oldenburg, Germany.

The Hannah Arendt Papers (The Library of Congress Manuscript Division). </figcaption> </figure> <p>The Library of Congress received the Arendt Papers as a gift and bequest from   Hannah Arendt in various installments from 1965 to 2000. Small additions were   made by Klaus Loewald in 1981 and Roger Errera in 1994. </p> <p>The papers span the years 1898 to 1977, with the bulk of the material   beginning in 1948, three years before Arendt’s naturalization as an American   citizen. The collection is organized in the following series: Family Papers,   Correspondence, Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and Writings File,   Clippings, Addition I, Addition II, and Addition III. Rich in manuscripts and   correspondence for Arendt\\'s productive years as a writer and lecturer after   World War II, the papers are sparse before the mid-1940s because of Arendt\\'s   forced departure from Nazi Germany in 1933 and her escape from occupied France   in 1941. Documentation for the first part of her life includes a few notebooks   and writings; several official and private records relating mainly to her   divorce, family history, and emigration; and a small group of personal   correspondence with her second husband, Heinrich Blücher, some of whose letters   and unpublished writings can be found in the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/articles-and-essays/family-papers/\">Family Papers</a> series. Much of   the material is in German and other European languages.</p> <p>Born Johanna Cohn Arendt, Arendt later used her married name, Blücher, in   private life. Arendt studied with Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg University, but her   career was diverted from teaching and writing for more than a decade as a result   of Adolf Hitler\\'s rise to power and the subsequent persecution of the Jews.   While in France and for several years in the United States, she worked as a   welfare agent in charge of aiding Jews and as a journalist for various Jewish   political and social organizations. Her papers document her support for the   creation of a Palestinian homeland for Jews until 1948, when she dissented from   certain policies of the new state of Israel.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/auden.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>W.H. Auden. Photographed by Arendt in her New York City   apartment, 1967. Courtesy of the Hannah Arendt Trust. </figcaption> </figure> <p>The largest portion of Arendt\\'s papers consists of the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/correspondence.html\">Correspondence</a> series subdivided under the   headings of General Correspondence, Organizations, Publishers, and Universities   and Colleges. The material traces Arendt\\'s intellectual, social, and   professional life from the late 1940s to her death. Though not a prolific letter   writer, Arendt corresponded with men and women of letters throughout Europe and   America, often for the purpose of giving a reference or arranging conference and   lecture dates, but just as frequently to exchange thoughts and ideas. Her   correspondents include obscure as well as renowned members of the literary and   academic community, many of whom sent her manuscripts in tribute to her   intellectual influence or to solicit her comments. Among the prominent   individuals whose names appear in the general correspondence are poets W. H.   Auden, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, and Stephen Spender; historians Joachim   C. Fest and Carl J. Friedrich; and writers Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Mary   McCarthy, and David Riesman. Readers should note that Arendt often typed replies   on the reverse side of the original letters that she received.</p> <p>Among correspondence pertaining to organizations, publishers, and   universities and colleges are occasional personal jottings from individuals who   wrote in an official capacity but were Arendt\\'s friends and acquaintances as   well. Among their letters is correspondence with publishers and editors,   especially Robert B. Silvers of the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, William   Shawn of the <em>New Yorker</em>, and William Jovanovich of Harcourt Brace   Jovanovich, and with Saul Bellow and other faculty members at the University of   Chicago where Arendt was a professor and graduate student adviser on the   Committee on Social Thought.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/eichmann.html\">Adolf Eichmann File</a> deals with what was perhaps Arendt\\'s best-known and most controversial work, <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>. Subtitled <em>A Report on the Banality of Evil</em>,   Arendt\\'s conclusions about the nature and character of totalitarian rule in Nazi   Germany, and her interpretation of the Jewish response to the Holocaust,   prompted a strenuous and often emotional debate gathered in folders containing   book reviews, articles, and letters to the editors of the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>. Also in the Eichmann files is material that Arendt   collected while covering the Nazi leader\\'s trial in Jerusalem in 1961, including   incomplete but extensive copies of English and German transcripts of the trial\\'s   proceedings, copies of the final ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, and   several files of notes and miscellaneous background information. Drafts and   other related material for <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> are located in the   Speeches and Writings series.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/subject.html\">Subject File</a> chiefly treats Arendt\\'s role as teacher and lecturer as reflected in the courses   she taught at the New School for Social Research, the University of California   at Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. Numerous lectures and seminar notes   by Arendt include copies of \"Kant\\'s Political Philosophy\" delivered at both the   New School and the University of Chicago. Also included is material relating to   Arendt\\'s students as well as contracts and royalties for her publications.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/speeches.html\">Speeches and Writings   File</a> spans the years 1923-75. Arendt\\'s doctoral dissertation, <em>Der   Liebesbegriff bei Augustin</em>, issued by Springer Verlag in 1929, is present in   the original published version and in a manuscript of an English translation, <em>Love and Saint Augustine</em>. Also in this series are various drafts of   lectures and chapters incorporated into Arendt\\'s two-volume work <em>The Life of   the Mind</em>, published posthumously in 1978. Other book-length manuscripts   include the first and final drafts of <em>Between Past and Future</em>; the first   and final corrected copies of <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>, with additional   drafts of the German translation; and <em>Men in Dark Times</em>. There are also   essays and lectures in the Speeches and Writings series in addition to the   lectures and seminar notes in the Subject File folders designated \"Courses\"   Research material arranged by topic is filed under \"Extracts and Notes\" in the   Speeches and Writings series. </p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/mccarthy.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy, ca. 1960s.

An English version of Kohler\\'s work entitled <em>Within Four Walls: The   Correspondence between Hannah Arendt and Heinrich Blücher, 1936-1968</em>,   translated by Peter Constantine (New York: Harcourt), was published in 2000.</p> <p>The papers of Hannah Arendt were initially organized and described in 1965   and 1967. A large group of the material received in 1977 was incorporated into   the collection in 1980. Items received in 1982 were processed as Addition I.   Material received between 1985 and 1997 was organized as Addition II in 1998,   and material comprising Addition III was received and organized in 2000. The   entire collection was reprocessed and the register was revised in 2000.

In view of the lengthy process that would have been   necessary to secure permission to release the entire collection online the   decision was made to concentrate on sections of the papers most useful for   researchers on Arendt and her work. With the advice of special consultant Jerome   Kohn, director of the Hannah Arendt Center, New School University, the project   staff identified the following series as the top priorities for seeking   copyright permissions: the Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and   Writings File, and Addition I, plus the \"General\" section of the Correspondence   File.</p> <p>The procedure to identify copyright holders of published and unpublished   materials in the collection written by people other than Hannah Arendt was a   complex one. For each document needing copyright permission, the author and   recipient, publisher or corporation, address, date, and biographical information   were recorded when available. This information was entered into a database to   facilitate research to identify and locate copyright holders in order to obtain   permissions. Resources online and in print were examined to locate the addresses   of approximately two thousand correspondents or their heirs in the United States   and numerous other countries.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge\\'s idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover\\'s standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation\\'s urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World\\'s fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class=\\'image-align-right\\'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.  The <a href=\"/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/articles-and-essays/forms-of-variety-theater/\">forms of variety theater</a> represented in this collection draw from several genres, including  vaudeville, minstrel show, burlesque, extravaganza, spectacle, musical  revue, and musical comedy.</p>'], 'timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:43:42.035Z', 'campaigns': [], 'extract_timestamp': '2019-11-22T09:26:29.783Z', 'date': '1996', 'shelf_id': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'other_title': ['Vaudeville and popular entertainment, 1870-1920'], 'count': 726, 'dates': ['1870-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1871-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1872-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1873-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1874-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1875-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1876-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1877-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1878-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1879-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1880-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1881-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1882-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1883-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1884-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1885-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1886-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1887-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1888-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1889-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1890-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1891-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1892-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1893-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1894-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1895-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1896-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1897-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1898-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1899-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1900-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1901-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1902-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1903-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1904-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1905-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1906-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1907-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1908-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1909-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1910-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1911-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1912-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1913-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1914-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1915-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1916-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1917-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1918-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1919-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1920-01-01T00:00:00Z', '1996-01-01T00:00:00Z'], 'number_lccn': ['96802670'], 'language': ['english'], 'url': '//memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'items': 'http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'hassegments': False, 'image_url': ['https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155', 'https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500'], 'aka': ['http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vshome.html', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/var/', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/varst/', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/american-variety-stage/', 'http://www.loc.gov/collections/vaudeville/', 'http://lccn.loc.gov/96802670', 'http://www.loc.gov/item/96802670/', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000048', 'http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000048/']}, {'number_oclc': ['86114510'], 'item': {'call_number': ['Z6951', 'AI3'], 'language': ['eng'], 'contributors': ['Library of Congress.', 'National Endowment for the Humanities.', 'National Digital Newspaper Program (U.S.)'], 'format': ['text'], 'notes': ['Began in 2006.', 'Title from title screen (viewed July 7, 2009).', '\"Chronicling America is sponsored jointly by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress as part of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP)\"--Title screen.'], 'title': 'Chronicling America : historic American newspapers.', 'summary': ['This database allows you to search and view public domain newspaper pages (1690-1963) and find information about American newspapers published between 1690-present.

This program funded state-level projects to locate, describe (catalog), and selectively preserve (via treatment and microfilm) historic newspaper collections in that state, published from 1690 to the present. Under this program, each institution created machine-readable cataloging (MARC) via the Cooperative ONline SERials Program (CONSER) for its state collections, contributing bibliographic descriptions and library holdings information to the Newspaper Union List, hosted by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). This data, approximately 140,000 bibliographic title entries and 600,000 separate library holdings records, was acquired and converted to MARCXML format for use in the Chronicling America Newspaper Title Directory. Contact a CONSER member for updates and corrections to bibliographic records (see <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html\">https://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/conmembs.html</a> ) through CONSER. The Chronicling America Directory bibliographic records are updated annually from the CONSER dataset hosted by OCLC.</p> <h3>Selected Digitized Newspaper Pages</h3>  <p>Each NDNP participant receives an award to select and digitize approximately 100,000 newspaper pages representing that state\\'s regional history, geographic coverage, and events of note. </p> <p>Participants are expected to digitize primarily from microfilm holdings for reasons of efficiency and cost, encouraging selection of technically-suitable film, bibliographic completeness, diversity and &quot;orphaned&quot; newspapers (newspapers that have ceased publication and lack active ownership) in order to decrease the likelihood of duplicative digitization by other organizations.</p> <p>These newspaper materials were digitized to technical specifications designed by the Library of Congress. These specifications include the following basic elements (profiles describing the full set of specifications can be found at <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/\">https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/</a>) : </p> <ul>     <li>TIFF 6.0, 8-bit grayscale, 400 dpi, uncompressed, with specified tag values</li>     <li>JPEG2000, Part 1; 8-bit component; 6 decomposition layers; 25 quality layers; 8:1 compression; with XML Box with specified RDF metadata</li>     <li>Single page PDF with hidden text; downsampled to 150 dpi, using JPEG compression; with XMP containing specified RDF metadata.</li>     <li>Single page machine-readable text encoded in ALTO, v. 2.0 XML; in column-reading order (created with Optical Character Recognition).</li>     <li>METS XML data objects describing newspaper issues, pages, and microfilm reels; incorporating elements in MODS, PREMIS, and MIX formats.</li> </ul>  <p>Chronicling America provides access to these digitized historic materials primarily through a Web interface enhanced with dynamic HTML interactivity for magnification and navigation. Searches are available for both full-text newspaper pages and bibliographic newspaper records (the Newspaper Directory). Pages are displayed in JPEG format, dynamically-created from source files on user request and presented through the browser interface using a combination of Javascript, DHTML and AJAX Web programming.</p> <h3>Preservation Data Repository and Dissemination Application</h3> <p>The NDNP repository developed for Chronicling America is based on the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) Reference Model for preservation repository architecture and supported by a variety of modular components to enable long-term sustainability of data ingestion, archival management and data dissemination. The public website is built using the Python programming language, Django Web framework, RDFLib, Apache Solr search server, Apache Web server, and MySQL database engine.

These items date from 1899 to 1981, with most from the 1920s through the 1950s, and were selected from Copland\\'s\\xa0music sketches,\\xa0correspondence,\\xa0writings, and\\xa0photographs.</p> <p>Celebrating the centennial of the birth of the American composer Aaron Copland (1900-1990), the multi-format Aaron Copland Collection, from which the online collection derives, spans the years 1910 to 1990 and includes approximately 400,000 items documenting the multifaceted life of an extraordinary person who was composer, performer, teacher, writer, conductor, commentator, and administrator. It comprises both manuscript and printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries, writings, scrapbooks, programs, newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, awards, books, sound recordings, and motion pictures.</p>   <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Aaron Copland devoted his life as a twentieth-century composer to fostering, developing, creating, and establishing distinctive \"American\" music. He became known as the \"Dean of American Music,\" a sobriquet with which he was uncomfortable. His name is synonymous with\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\\xa0—the winner of the 1945 Pulitzer Prize in Music—and\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/f/#work0021\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>.</p> <p>Copland extensively documented the many facets of his life in music, and the<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\\xa0at the Library of Congress reflects the entire breadth of his endeavors. Beginning in the late 1950s and early &lsquo;60s, Copland periodically deposited his original music manuscripts at the Library of Congress and subsequently converted them to gifts. In the fall of 1989, he donated all his papers to the Library. The collection numbers approximately four hundred thousand items, dating from 1910 to 1990 with a few nineteenth-century photographs, and includes his music manuscripts, printed music, personal and business correspondence, diaries and writings, photographic materials, awards, honorary degrees, programs, and other biographical materials. It is the primary resource for research on Aaron Copland and a major resource for the study of musical life in twentieth-century America generally, particularly from the 1920s to the 1960s.</p> <p>The online\\xa0Aaron Copland Collection\\xa0comprises approximately one thousand items selected from Copland\\'s\\xa0music sketches,\\xa0correspondence,\\xa0writings, and photographs. The items are represented in about five thousand digitized images, the earliest an 1899 photograph and the latest a 1986 letter. While the original collection contains almost all Copland\\'s music manuscripts and printed scores, the online collection presents the original music sketches that Copland used in composing thirty-one works spanning the years 1924 to 1967 and covering every medium in which he composed: orchestral, ballet, opera, film, chamber, solo piano, and vocal music.</p> <p>The correspondence in the online collection comprises images of approximately eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Copland that have been selected from the Aaron Copland Collection and other collections in the\\xa0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\\xa0at the Library of Congress. Besides letters to his parents and other family members in the 1920s and 30s, the correspondence includes Copland\\'s letters to his Parisian teacher Nadia Boulanger, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, and others such as Nicolas Slonimsky, Roger Sessions, Carlos Chávez, Walter Piston, Leonard Bernstein, and Benjamin Britten.</p> <p>As an advocate and supporter of American music and American composers, Copland frequently wrote articles, presented lectures, and delivered speeches. The online\\xa0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\\xa0presents eighty-six of Copland\\'s previously unpublished drafts. These show the creative process through which he wrote about his own music, other composers and their music, and other people who played important roles in his musical life.</p> <p>Of the twelve thousand photographic materials in the Library\\'s Aaron Copland Collection, 111 items have been chosen for online presentation. Many were created by Copland\\'s friend Victor Kraft, a professional photographer. They include portraits of Aaron Copland at various ages and places, with family members, with other composers, and with other people associated with his career as a composer and conductor, as well as images from his worldwide travels.</p>  <h2>The Copland Letters</h2>  <p>\"The man is in the letters,\" said Vivian Perlis of Aaron Copland, whose autobiography she helped to write. The online\\xa0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>\\xa0contains digitized images of over eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland covering the years from 1921 to 1986. Searchable texts of all published letters, postcards, and telegrams in the collection are also available.</p> <p>The letters reproduced in the collection represent, though they do not exhaust, the holdings of Copland\\'s correspondence in the\\xa0<a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/perform/\">Music Division</a>\\xa0of the Library of Congress. In general they constitute significant runs of letters to people important in Copland\\'s life. (Problems of copyright and volume preclude making letters to Copland available online.) Every attempt has been made to include all the letters in the Music Division that Copland wrote to each correspondent represented, the one exception being the letters to Harold Spivacke, which constitute only a part of Copland\\'s voluminous and largely business-related correspondence with the Music Division\\'s former chief.</p> <p>These letters come from many collections in the Music Division. Besides material from the Aaron Copland Collection, they contain material from the Leonard Bernstein Collection, the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Collection, the Jacobo Ficher Collection, the Irving Fine Collection, the Louis Kaufman Collection, the Serge Koussevitzky Collection, the\\xa0<em>Modern Music</em>\\xa0Archives, the Walter Piston Collection, the Nicolas Slonimsky Collection, the William Strickland Collection, and the papers of the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music.</p> <p>The letters Copland wrote that are in the Copland Collection proper came back to him in various ways. He inherited his letters to his parents after their deaths. In the 1970s, when he began to think of writing his autobiography, he asked several of his friends and colleagues to send him photocopies of his letters. Some replied with photocopies, some by returning the letters themselves. Some responded with many letters, some with just a few.</p> <p>Copland seldom made carbons copies of his outgoing correspondence. The few periods in his life for which the Copland Collection is rich in carbon copies are the brief intervals when he had a secretary: in 1943 while working on the film\\xa0<em>The North Star</em>; during his South American tour in 1947; in the fall of 1958 when he was staying in London and presumably was provided with a secretary by his publisher, Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Because they were obviously dictated to a secretary, these letters have the flavor of Copland\\'s post-1940 correspondence but are not particularly trenchant, lacking the distinctive qualities that came forth when Copland himself sat down to write.</p>  <p>The following individuals are the major correspondents represented in the letters portion of this online collection. They are listed with the source collection for Copland\\'s letters to them or, in the case of material in the Copland Collection itself, with an indication of whether the letters are originals or photocopies.</p> <p><strong>Arthur Berger</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopy). The online collection contains a <a href=\"/resource/copland.corr0796?sp=1\">single letter</a>\\xa0to this writer of the first book-length study of Copland; it is perhaps the most evocative of Copland\\'s letters describing his Mexican visits.</p> <p><strong>Leonard Bernstein</strong>\\xa0(Bernstein Collection). Copland\\'s protégé in the late 1930s and early 1940s,\\xa0Bernstein\\xa0became one of the leading champions and interpreters of Copland\\'s music.</p> <p><strong>Nadia Boulanger</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; originals). Copland\\'s principal teacher and mentor. His Nonet is dedicated to her.</p> <p><strong>Paul Bowles</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; originals). Composer and novelist. The two letters in the Copland Collection seem to have been part of a voluminous and regular correspondence.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Britten</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopies). English composer. The first set of\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\\xa0was written for Britten and his collaborator Peter Pears. Britten\\'s side of the correspondence is published in Donald Mitchell et al., eds.,\\xa0<em>Letters from a Life: The Selected Letters and Diaries of Benjamin Britten, 1913-1976\\xa0</em>(2 vols., Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991).</p> <p><strong>Carlos Chávez</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopies). Mexican composer; one of Copland\\'s principal composer friends. As a conductor, Chávez performed Copland\\'s <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/s/#work0012\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\\xa0when American conductors had declared it unperformable. Chávez\\'s side of the correspondence and slightly abridged versions of Copland\\'s letters are published in Spanish translation in Gloria Carmona, ed.,\\xa0<em>Epistolario selecto de Carlos Chávez</em>\\xa0(México: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1989).</p> <p><strong>Israel Citkowitz\\xa0</strong>(Copland Collection; originals). Citkowitz was a slightly younger composer (1909-1974), gifted in song and chamber music, for whom Copland had high hopes. The online collection contains all Copland\\'s letters to Citkowitz in the Copland Collection.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge</strong>\\xa0(Coolidge Collection). American patron of chamber music. She commissioned from Copland (and thus had dedicated to her) <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\\xa0and the\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/q/#work0067\">Piano Quartet</a>.</p> <p><strong>Jacobo Ficher</strong>\\xa0(Ficher Collection). Argentinian composer. Copland\\'s letters to him document his interest in South American music.</p> <p><strong>Irving and Verna Fine</strong>\\xa0(Irving Fine Collection). Irving Fine was a composer and younger colleague of Copland whose choral arrangements of several of Copland\\'s <a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0041\"><em>Old American Songs</em></a>\\xa0have given them a life as choral works. Copland shared houses with Irving and Verna Fine for several summers at Tanglewood. After Irving Fine\\'s death in 1962 Copland continued to be supportive of Verna Fine, and his letters to her retain warmth and sparkle to the end of his letter-writing years. Copland dedicated \"Sleep Is Supposed to Be,\" one of the two central songs of his<em> </em><a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0074\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>, to Irving Fine. The Irving Fine Collection also contains letters from Copland to Verna Fine\\'s mother, Florence Rudnick, in whose Boston apartment he sequestered himself to write\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/i/#work0065\"><em>In the Beginning</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky</strong>\\xa0(Koussevitzky Collection). Serge Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony from 1924 to 1949, was the first performer to champion Copland\\'s music in America and remained a supporter of Copland (and of many other American composers) until his death. Copland, in turn, was a major help to Koussevitzky from 1940 on in the running of the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood. Copland\\'s letters to Koussevitzky\\'s first wife, Natalie, are, for the most part, social; his letters to Koussevitzky\\'s second wife, Olga (Olga Naumoff, Koussevitzky\\'s secretary, until 1947), concern the running of Tanglewood. Copland\\'s\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/t/#work0025\">Third Symphony</a>\\xa0is dedicated \"To the memory of Natalie Koussevitzky.\"</p> <p><strong>Minna Lederman</strong>\\xa0(<em>Modern Music</em>\\xa0Archives). Lederman was editor of the journal of the League of Composers,\\xa0<em>Modern Music</em>, which was published from 1924 to 1946. Copland was a major contributor to the magazine and a trusted advisor to Lederman.</p> <p><strong>Marcelle de Manziarly</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; originals). French composer, Boulanger student. Copland dedicated \"Heart, We Will Forget Him,\" the fifth of his<em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em>, to de Manziarly.</p>  <p><strong>Olga Naumoff:</strong>\\xa0see Serge, Natalie, and Olga Koussevitzky.</p> <p><strong>Walter Piston</strong>\\xa0(Piston Collection). American composer. The body of Piston\\'s correspondence is in the Boston Public Library; the one letter in this online collection represents the small but important collection of letters to Piston from the years 1931-55 that is in the Music Division of the Library of Congress.</p> <p><strong>Florence Rudnick:</strong>\\xa0see Irving and Verna Fine.</p> <p><strong>Roger Sessions</strong>\\xa0(Copland Collection; photocopies) American composer; co-producer with Copland of the Copland-Sessions Concerts during the years 1928-31.</p> <p><strong>Nicolas Slonimsky</strong>\\xa0(Slonimsky Collection; some early letters in the Koussevitzky Collection). Musical polymath. During most of the period in which Copland corresponded with him he was musical secretary to Koussevitzky; the jokey letters to the incorrigibly humorous Slonimsky serve to balance Copland\\'s oh-so-serious letters to Koussevitzky himself.</p> <p><strong>Harold Spivacke</strong>\\xa0(Coolidge Collection; Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation, Sub-Committee on Music). Chief of the Music Division of the Library of Congress, 1937-1972. Spivacke\\'s tact and unflappable serenity kept the commissioning of\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/a/#work0030\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>\\xa0on course.</p> <p><strong>William Strickland</strong>\\xa0(Strickland Collection). American conductor. Some of the letters in this online collection are concerned with Strickland\\'s editorship of the H. W. Gray organ series, for which Copland wrote his\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/e/#work0097\"><em>Episode</em></a>.</p> <p>\"The man is in the letters.\" It might then seem as though a collection of more than eight hundred letters, postcards, and telegrams from Aaron Copland would give a complete portrait of the man and the composer. However, users of this online collection should remember that these letters represent only the holdings of the Music Division of the Library of Congress. At least equally important are Copland\\'s letters to Virgil Thomson (at Yale University); Claire Reis and William Schuman (at the New York Public Library); Howard Clurman, David Diamond, and Walter Piston (at the Boston Public Library); and several others. To each of his correspondents Copland shows a slightly different aspect of his personality, so the letters in this online collection provide a detailed self-portrait if not a complete one.</p>  <h2>The Copland Sketches</h2>  <p>This online collection contains approximately 2500 pages of Aaron Copland\\'s sketches\\xa0for his music, representing thirty-one of his works—thirty-three if one includes the\\xa0<em>Sextet</em>\\xa0and the\\xa0<em>Orchestra Variations</em>, covered by the sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>\\xa0and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>\\xa0respectively. Representing many of Copland\\'s best-known and most significant works, the sketches are often revelatory. Except for some miscellaneous accompanying material, the online collection includes all the sketches for the works in the online collection.</p> <p>There are works for which the Library of Congress\\'s archival Copland Collection contains no sketches. These include some of the early works and the\\xa0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>. Those who are interested in finding out whether the Library has sketches for a particular work not represented in the online collection, or curious about whether one of the works included has any material not presented online, should consult the Copland Collection Finding Aid.</p> <p>Within the sections of the online collection, the sketches are presented as much as possible in the order in which they were received from Aaron Copland or his estate. They have been much used by scholars, and they represent Copland\\'s not always systematic use of music-paper. Some sets of sketches have been numbered by stamp at their top left- or right-hand corner; this numeration was done by the Library of Congress when the sketches were filmed in the mid-1970s and do not represent Copland\\'s numbering. When two separate sets of sketches exist for a single work, they are presented here as two separate items. (Note: The page numbers of some of these sketches may not appear in numerical order online. However, they are presented here in exactly the order that Copland produced them.)</p> <p>The sketches reveal to scholars the history of Copland\\'s work on the compositions, but they can also mean something to the general reader. The sketches for the <a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0011?sp=1\"><em>Piano Variations</em></a>, the\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0010?sp=1\"><em>Short Symphony</em></a>, and the\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0022?sp=1\"><em>Fanfare for the Common Man</em></a>\\xa0show Copland searching for titles to do justice to three of his most characteristic works; the sketches for\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0032?sp=1\"><em>Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson</em></a>\\xa0show him deciding what poems to include in the cycle; the sketches for\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0015?sp=1\"><em>Billy the Kid</em></a> show that the opening music was first intended to be the start of\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.sket0014?sp=1\"><em>Music for Radio</em></a>— which now begins with much more complex music.</p>  <h2>The Copland Photographs</h2>  <p>The photographic materials in the Library of Congress\\'s\\xa0<em>Aaron Copland Collection</em>number more than twelve thousand items spanning the years 1889 to 1985 and include both black and white and color prints, contact sheets, 35-mm negatives, color slides, and photograph albums. A substantial number of photographs were taken by Copland\\'s lifelong friend, the professional photographer Victor Kraft. Widely known photographers whose work can be found in the collection include Carl Van Vechten, Irving Penn, Gordon Parks, and Margaret Bourke-White. The subject material comprises an inclusive chronology of Copland\\'s life and includes Copland\\'s family; Copland himself throughout his life; friends; acquaintances; fellow composers and other people with whom he worked; places where he studied, composed, or visited; and special events.</p> <p>From this vast collection, 111 photographs have been initially selected for the online collection. The digitized images fall into five broad categories: Family ; Copland Alone; Copland\\'s Music; Copland with Other Composers and People; and Places and Events. Photographs that cannot be dated precisely or approximately have been given the designation of \"middle\" or \"late.\"</p> <h2>Family</h2> <p>Of the seven family photographs, one is a formal sitting of Copland\\'s paternal grandparents and three of their children, while another shows Copland\\'s parents, Sarah and Harris Copland, in front of their department store in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922. The other five capture Copland with other family members.</p> <h2>Aaron Copland Alone</h2> <p>The twenty-four photographs of Copland alone show him both formally and informally and at a range of ages from six to his seventies. Several feature Copland at his home, Rock Hill, in Courtlandt near Peekskill, New York.</p>  <h2>Copland\\'s Music</h2> <p>Twenty-one photographs capture performances or rehearsals of thirteen musical works. The orchestral works represented are the\\xa0<em>Piano Concerto</em>, in a photograph showing Copland at the piano and André Previn conducting; the\\xa0<em>Clarinet Concerto</em>with Benny Goodman as the soloist and Copland conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and the\\xa0<em>Lincoln Portrait</em>\\xa0in two rehearsal photographs, one in color with Marian Anderson as the speaker and the other with Adlai Stevenson, both with Copland conducting. The two ballets represented are scenes from the premiere performance of\\xa0<em>Appalachian Spring</em>\\xa0at the Library of Congress and\\xa0<em>Billy the Kid</em>, which was premiered by Lincoln Kirstein and the Ballet Caravan.</p> <p>Three of the eight films for which Copland wrote music scores are illustrated in this online collection. Production stills represent\\xa0<em>The North Star</em>\\xa0and\\xa0<em>The Red Pony</em>. There are also two informal photographs of the making of\\xa0<em>The Red Pon</em>y depicting Copland with the pony and the young boy and one studio-recording shot of Copland conducting the music for\\xa0<em>Something Wild</em>\\xa0that shows the star, Carroll Baker, in a television monitor.</p> <p>One chamber work is represented in a rehearsal of the\\xa0<em>Nonet</em>\\xa0at the Library of Congress with Copland conducting. Two photographs depict William Warfield with Copland during rehearsals of\\xa0<em>Old American Songs</em>. There is also a stage shot of the opera\\xa0<em>The Tender Land</em>.</p>  <h2>Copland with Other Composers and People</h2> <p>Numerous photographs capture Copland with fellow composers, including Leonard Bernstein, Carlos Chávez, Norman Dello Joio, Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, Irving Fine, Arthur Berger, Douglas Moore, Benjamin Britten, Darius Milhaud, Philip Ramey, Walter Piston, Domingo Santa Cruz, Virgil Thomson, Roger Sessions, and Igor Stravinsky. He is also shown with such notable cultural figures and musicians as Artur Rubinstein, Claire Booth Luce, Clarence Adler, Nadia Boulanger, Victor Kraft, Vivian Perlis, Claire Reis, Jack Garfein, Thorton Wilder, Serge Koussevitzky, Agnes de Mille, and Oliver Smith.</p> <h2>Places and Events</h2> <p>The group of photographs entitled Places and Events shows Coplan Fontainebleau and Aldeburgh; in Paris, Germany, England, Peru, Israel, and Mexico; at Nadia Boulanger\\'s studio with other students; at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and Tanglewood; and at the University of Kansas, Brown University and Columbia University.</p> <h2>The Copland Writings</h2>  <p>Aaron Copland was best known first as a composer and later, in the 1960s and \\'70s, as a conductor. His name is less frequently associated with literary endeavors. The\\xa0Writings\\xa0portion of the\\xa0Aaron Copland Collection\\xa0suggests that in this respect his reputation should perhaps be revised: it includes a vast array of articles, lectures, speeches, book drafts, and radio and television commentaries that span the years 1925 to 1988. The long stream of Copland\\'s literary efforts began with an article written for publication in 1925, shortly after his return to the United States from three years in Paris, and continued into the late 1970s and early 1980s. He displayed the same technique in his writings that he did in his music: that is, a frequent self-borrowing in which he used the same material in different media.</p> <p>The writings selected for this online collection comprise eighty-six items. The selections represent unpublished drafts of material for articles, lectures, and speeches. Some selections display Copland\\'s literary processes in thoughtful revisions, word changes, rearranging, and other editorial techniques. He usually began with handwritten notes or drafts and proceeded through several typewritten drafts before creating a final unmarked typewritten version. (Example: \"A Visit to Snape,\"\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0026?sp=1\">Version 2</a>\\xa0and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0027?sp=1\">Version 3</a>\\xa0) Not every literary work in the Aaron Copland Collection illustrates this transformation, however. The lectures and speeches display another aspect of Copland\\'s literary endeavors: the fact that he underscored almost every word in red or blue pencil. Because he probably made these markings to help him deliver his speeches, they recapture something of the sound as well as the thought of his vocal presentations. They also add a colorful element to the handwritten and typed drafts.</p> <p>Like many conductors, Copland used a similar device in his conducting scores, where red and blue pencil markings draw the eye to changes in time signature, dynamics, and the entrances of instruments. [Example:\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0092?sp=1\">\"Talk on Leonard Bernstein\"</a>]</p> <p>Whatever their intended uses, the online examples of Copland\\'s unpublished writings can be grouped into four categories: autobiographical, about Copland\\'s music, about other composers, and about other people.</p> <p>The two autobiographical titles contrast the esoteric concerns of\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0005?sp=1\">\"Music and the Human Spirit\"</a>, in which Copland addresses \"the creation of an art music\" as one of \"humanity\\'s truly unique achievements,\" with the practicality of\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0003?sp=1\">\"The Composer as Conductor\"</a>\\xa0in which he recalls that \"Some twenty years ago, during the course of a memorable evening at the Stravinskys\\' home in Los Angeles, the venerable maestro turned to me and said in no uncertain terms: \\'My dear, you should conduct your own music. All composers should conduct their own music!\\'\"</p> <p>The writings about Copland\\'s music highlight eleven of Copland\\'s compositions in five different media. Writings on two ballets describe his collaboration with Martha Graham (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0007?sp=1\"><em>Appalachian Spring</em></a>) and his work with Lincoln Kirstein on the story for<em>Billy the Kid</em>, (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0008?sp=1\">\"About\\xa0<em>Billy the Kid</em></a>\" and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0018?sp=1\">\"Notes on a Cowboy Ballet\"</a>). Copland discusses the creation of his three major solo piano works,\\xa0<em>Piano Fantasy</em>\", \"<em>Piano Sonata</em>,\" and \"<em>Piano Variations</em>,\" in two different lectures under the title <a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0011?sp=1\">Compositional Phases [on My Three Piano Works]</a>.\" An article about the 1925 orchestral work\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0017?sp=1\"><em>Music for the Theatre</em></a>\\xa0summarizes the reaction of audiences, musicians, and reviewers in the United States and Europe, including the performance by the New York Symphony Orchestra in which its conductor, Dr. Walter Damrosch, had \"revenge in the end.\" Copland wrote\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0028?sp=1\">A Visit to Snape</a>\\xa0for a tribute to Benjamin Britten on his fiftieth birthday; in it, he extols the \"kind of composer rapport\" between them and the \"exchange of musical impressions\" between his own \"The Second Hurricane\" and Britten\\'s Piano Concerto No. 1.</p> <p>As the composer of several film scores, Copland was frequently asked to lecture or write about composing for the movies. In his discussions on the subject, Copland speaks not only about his experiences and the scores he wrote, but about other film composers and working in Hollywood. In\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0012?sp=1\">\"Film Music\"</a>, a lecture given at the Museum of Modern Art Film Library in 1940, Copland briefly describes Hollywood and the mysterious nature of film music. He talks about the music he wrote for the film\\xa0<a href=\"/collections/aaron-copland/articles-and-essays/works-listing-by-title/o/#work0049\"><em>Of Mice and Men</em></a>; four film composers, Eric Korngold, Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, and Herbert Stoddard; and some of their film scores. By the time he gave the lecture\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0015?sp=1\">\"Film Talk\"</a>\\xa0at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1971, Copland\\'s credentials as a film composer included six feature films and two documentaries. On that occasion, excerpts from three features (<em>Something Wild</em>,\\xa0<em>The Red Pony</em>, and\\xa0<em>The Heiress</em>) and one documentary (<em>The City</em>) were screened as he commented on how music may help a film and how one sets music to a film.</p> <p>The largest category of writings in this online collection centers on Copland\\'s views about other composers. In these works, Copland speaks not only about his American contemporaries but about Mozart\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0037?sp=1\">(\"At the Thought of Mozart\")</a>, Berlioz\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0039?sp=1\">(\"Berlioz - from the Composer\\'s Standpoint\")</a>, and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0040?sp=1\">Pierre Boulez</a>;<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0049?sp=1\">Composers in Russia</a>\\xa0and the\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0051?sp=1\">Composers of South America</a>; Michael Tippett (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0055?sp=1\">\"Cousin Michael\"</a>),\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0057?sp=1\">Darius Milhaud</a>, Dmitri Shostakovitch (<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0059?sp=1\">\"Dmitri Shostakovitch and the New Simplicity\"</a>),\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0060?sp=1\">Gabriel Fauré</a>,\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0062?sp=1\">Franz Liszt</a>, Gustav Mahler\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0077?sp=1\">(\"Mahler (XX Cent[ury]\")</a>,\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0091?sp=1\">Igor Stravinsky</a>, Serge Prokofieff [Sergey Prokofiev]\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0087?sp=1\">(\"On the Occasion of the 70th Birthday of Serge Prokofieff\")\\xa0</a>, Benjamin Britten\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0090?sp=1\">(\"Special Fondness for B.B. [Benjamin Britten]\")\\xa0</a>, and\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0097?sp=1\">Zoltán Kodály</a>. Copland was concerned above all with educating others about composers and their music, and in these writings he sometimes presents his personal viewpoints and reflections. At the National Arts Club in 1968, for example, he spoke about Leonard Bernstein\\'s gifts and how it was \"impossible to imagine the American musical scene in the last quarter century without him.\" [Example:\\xa0<a href=\"/resource/copland.writ0075?sp=1\">\"LB\"</a>]</p> <p>As Copland lived on through the century, he was asked to write celebratory epistles or obituaries about many of his contemporaries, whether they were composers or others who had influenced his life.

M. the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II to the national library of the United States of America through the Honorable A.S. Hewitt Member of the House of Representatives A.H. 1302-1884 A.D.\" </p>  <p>The Sultan\\'s gift arrived in the U.S. Capitol, where the Library of Congress was housed, until the Jefferson Building was completed and they could be unpacked and shelved.</p>  <p>In the 1907 Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam stated: \"About 400 volumes, bound in red Morocco with gilt edges, have been given by the present Sultan, Ghasee Abdul-Hamid II. They comprise works of native authorship, also translations from European languages of works on Medicine, History, Law, Mathematics, Arts, Drama, Fiction, etc.\"</p>  <p>The remarkable story of how the Sultan met and befriended Abram Stevens Hewitt (1822-1903), Member from New York\\'s 10th district, reported in the <em>New York Tribune </em>(July 13, 1884), began while Hewitt and his young son were touring around St. Sophia and palace grounds in Constantinople during a very hot day. When the young boy fainted, he was taken to the guard house where two other boys his age observed all the excitement and reported back to their father, the Sultan, what they had seen.\\xa0Their father dispatched his emissaries to Hewitt\\'s hotel to inquire about his son\\'s well-being and to request that he and his son visit the palace the next day.</p>  <p>During the visit, the Sultan noticed Hewitt\\'s indelible pencil and special cigarettes which resulted in a gift shipment to Abdul-Hamid II when Hewitt returned home. Shortly thereafter, Hewitt received a notice that he owed $1,480 in customs duties on a shipment of Ottoman books. He wrote back to the Sultan that he didn\\'t deserve such an honor and that the Sultan should give the books to the Library of Congress. The Sultan agreed and had the special collection prepared for the Library and invited Hewitt to keep the first set for himself. Hewitt paid the duty and this set is now in the New York University Elmer Holmes Bobst Library.</p>  <p>By 1984, it was determined that the Abdul-Hamid II gift books had become very brittle with paper that was too fragile to serve to researchers and a decision was made to microfilm the collection. 309 books and serials have been scanned from this microfilm for this digital collection.

The Lincoln Papers came to the Library of  Congress from Lincoln\\'s oldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln (1843-1926), who  arranged for their organization and care shortly after his father was  assassinated on April 14, 1865. At that time, Robert Todd Lincoln had the  Lincoln Papers removed to Illinois, where they were first organized under the  direction of Judge David Davis of Bloomington, Illinois, Abraham Lincoln\\'s  longtime associate. Later, Lincoln&rsquo;s presidential secretaries, John G. Nicolay  and John Hay, assisted in the project. In 1874, most of the Lincoln Papers  returned to Washington, D.C., and Nicolay and Hay used them in the research and  writing of their ten-volume biography, <em>Abraham Lincoln: A History</em> (New  York, 1890). Robert Todd Lincoln deposited the Lincoln Papers with the Library  of Congress in 1919, and deeded them to the Library on January 23, 1923. The  deed stipulated that the Lincoln Papers remain sealed until twenty-one years  after Robert Todd Lincoln&rsquo;s death. On July 26, 1947, the Lincoln Papers were  officially opened to the public. </p>  <p>The most complete account  of the early history of the Abraham Lincoln Papers appears in volume 1 of David  C. Mearns, <em>The Lincoln Papers</em> (Garden City, N.Y., 1948), 3-136. An  article by the same author which appeared in the December 1947 issue of the <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/alajournals/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Abraham Lincoln Quarterly</em> <i class=\"icon icon-external-link\"><span>External</span></i></a> contains the substance of the story.

Original  items contained in Series 4 are included in this online collection and include  letters written by Abraham Lincoln, an autobiographical sketch written in 1859  at the request of Jesse W.

The Lincoln Studies Center at Knox  College in Galesburg, Illinois performed the editorial work, which included  selecting the documents to be transcribed. &nbsp;Their choices were based on  either a document\\'s historical importance or as representative of the  president&rsquo;s unsolicited incoming mail. Annotated transcriptions were provided  for all of the documents in Lincoln\\'s own hand and for secretarial copies of  Lincoln documents located in Series 1-3 of the Lincoln Papers.&nbsp;Many of the  other transcriptions were also annotated to aid users in identifying the people  involved and in better understanding the content and historical contexts.&nbsp;Annotations for Lincoln\\'s  autograph documents usually include a headnote providing historical and  documentary context, as well as annotations on the content of the document.  Annotations for incoming correspondence typically identify persons and  organizations writing to Lincoln or referred to in the documents, explain terms  and events, and provide brief historical context. Together, these fully  searchable transcriptions and annotations dramatically extend access to the  Abraham Lincoln Papers and enhance their teaching and research value.

He traveled in a 1935 Plymouth sedan, toting a Presto disc recorder and a movie camera. When he returned nearly three months later, having driven thousands of miles on barely paved roads, it was with a cache of 250 instantaneous discs and eight reels of film documenting the incredible range of ethnic diversity and expressive traditions primarily in Michigan. </p> <p>The Alan Lomax collection of Michigan and Wisconsin recordings (AFC 1939/007) documents Irish, Italian, Finnish, Serbian, Lithuanian, Polish, German, Croatian, French Canadian, Hungarian, Romanian, and Swedish songs and stories, as well as occupational folklife among loggers and lake sailors in Michigan and Wisconsin. Lomax&rsquo;s itinerary took him from Detroit through the Saginaw River valley to the northern counties of the Lower Peninsula, including Beaver Island. Crossing the Straits of Mackinac, he collected across the Upper Peninsula to the far northern Calumet area and then along the Lake Superior coast to easternmost Wisconsin.</p> <p>The recordings in this collection and related collections in the American Folklife Center provide early documentation of the Upper Midwest&rsquo;s rich culture. This collection is the result of a conscious decision by the Library of Congress to undertake regional documentation of American folk song in recognition that the voices of ordinary people have a place at the national library. The sound recordings in this online collection are presented in their raw form, as full disc sides without speed correction or other digital processing.

Therefore, one of the main objectives of the selection process was to identify those materials which mainly focused on Alexander Graham Bell and his work, varied interests, and achievements. Another important goal was to choose those materials that best offered a well-rounded portrayal of Bell--not only as an inventor and scientist but also as a teacher, husband, and father. Items were also selected if they appeared historically useful or significant, such as correspondence pertaining to the development of the Bell Telephone Company or Mabel Hubbard Bell\\'s written accounts of her experiences growing up deaf. </p>  <p> The Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers were donated to the Library of Congress by his heirs in 1975. Prior to this donation, the papers were on deposit at the National Geographic Society, where they were organized and maintained. In order to make the collection easier to use, the Society prepared typed transcripts of a large portion of the handwritten letters. These valuable transcriptions were retained and have been reproduced here along with the original letters. Occasionally the original is missing and only the transcription is still available. One should keep in mind that these transcripts are now decades old and may occasionally be difficult to read due to faded, bleeding, or blurred text.</p>  <p> The Bell Papers contain a considerable amount of correspondence, much of which reflects the writing practices of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As letter writing becomes less popular, some awareness of common, older practices may be helpful. Since the typical handwritten letter is essentially a single sheet of paper folded in half (and usually written on all four sides), the digital scan and display of each unfolded sheet usually show an image of pages four and one (or back and front), and another of pages three and two (or the inside two pages). <a href=\"/resource/magbell.03500220/seq-1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Today\\'s readers also should be aware of such papers-saving tactics as writing-over, or text over text. In such cases, the writer would literally write over a completed page, making the added words somewhat readable by turning the page sideways and writing horizontally against what were now vertical written lines. <a href=\"/resource/magbell.02800127/?sp=1\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a> Surprisingly, if the writer was careful and lengthened his or her hand while also trying to write only in the spaces between lines, such letters can be read with little difficulty. </p>    <div class=\"i_aligncenter i_caption\"       style=\"width: 444px;\">  <a href=\"/item/magbellbib000925\"><img

United States, and cases forming the LeGuen v. Gouverneur and Kemble litigation.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+financial+papers%2C+1782-1804\">Financial Papers, 1782-1804</a> (Reel 29)</strong><br>    The financial papers, which form the smallest segment of the collection, consist of two volumes of accounts relating to Hamilton\\'s law practice, and a folder of miscellaneous receipts. Some of the receipts are for money Hamilton paid engineer William Pearce on behalf of the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures to provide machinery for manufacturing cotton, 1791-1792.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+family+papers%2C+1737-1917\">Family Papers, 1737-1917</a></strong>  (Reels 29-31)</strong><br>    Letters and other documents of members of the Hamilton, Schuyler, and related families, but not including Alexander Hamilton himself.

Through the marriage of Philip Hamilton to Rebecca McLane, several McLane family letters were incorporated into the papers. Most of the nonfamily correspondence of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton relates to the management of her properties and to arrangements for the publication of Hamilton\\'s papers. Scattered letters addressed to Alexander Hamilton (Alexander and Elizabeth\\'s grandson), James A. Hamilton, John Church Hamilton, and to members of the McLane family are also included.</li>   <li><strong><a href=\"/collections/alexander-hamilton-papers/?fa=partof%3Aalexander+hamilton+papers%3A+miscellany%2C+1711-1820\">Miscellany, 1711-1820</a> (Reels 31-34)</strong><br>    A mixture of original and copied documents.

Fifty-one of these, 1790-1804, are from Philip Schuyler (1733-1804) to his  son-in-law Alexander Hamilton and daughter Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton.
